Some software documentation is written for developers or even contributed by developers, such as docs for API or SDK. Following the philosophy of Docs-as-code, the document will be written in Markdown and published on a website; it may not need a print-out version like PDF. As a result, the procedure will change accordingly.\n\n"},"__N_SSG":true}
