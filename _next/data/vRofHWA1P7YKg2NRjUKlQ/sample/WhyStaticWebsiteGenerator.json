We also want the site to work at a low cost and minimal coding time.\n\nThis is the situation the Static Website Generator gets in.\n\nA static site generator can get your website running in a super short time, sometimes maybe in ten minutes. It can also minimize your maintenance work. It allows you to write your pages as markdown files and add them to the content folder.\n\nRight now, there are many static website generators. Hugo is the one that is getting more popular.\n"},"__N_SSG":true}
