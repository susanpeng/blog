That would save me a lot of time searching for information or reading the Hugo manual from the beginning.\n\nThis How-to can also help developers who are familiar with GitHub and command lines and only need simple command lines without detailed explanations.\n\nI didn't write the detailed steps for some common git operations.\n\nTo create this How-to:\n1. I watched several videos and read some articles. I couldn't get things done by watching only one video because each video had some unclear places.\n2. I wrote down steps with simple explanations while building up the website and putting it on GitHub\n3. I double-checked each step to ensure the commands and their order were correct.\n4. I edited the text of the How-to and rephrased the sentences to make them clear and concise.\n5. I uploaded the original .md file to this site.\n6. I ran: hugo -t hugo-theme-even (the theme I used).\n7. I uploaded the static files to my GitHub repo susanpeng.github.io.\n\n\n"},"__N_SSG":true}
