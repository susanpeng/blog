It can run under Apache Web Server well but can't display larger images.\n\nI also uploaded the build folder to the ylpengreact repo on GitHub. Wonderfully, it runs well there; also, it can't display larger images. It displays small images correctly, correct position and correct appearance.\n\nThen I tried to make the larger images display for a long time but failed. I will do it later.\n\nIt has another issue. It will show blank and only work properly after changing the paths in the index.html file by taking away the beginning slash."},"__N_SSG":true}
