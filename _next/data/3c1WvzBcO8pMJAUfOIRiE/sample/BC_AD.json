How can you use them correctly?\n\nFirstly, both systems count years from the birth of Jesus Christ, following the Gregorian calendar. AD and CE mean before the birth date of Jesus, and BC and BCE mean after the birth date of Jesus.\n\nBC and AD were used earlier in the year 525 by a Christian monk.\nAD stands for \"Anno Domini\", which is Latin and means \"in the year of the Lord\"; BC stands for \"Before Christ\".\nBCE and CE  were used in the early 1700s, mostly in science and academia, becoming widespread for the reason of religious neutrality.\nCE stands for \"commoon era\", and BCE stands for \"before common era\".\n\nAt present, both systems are used widely. When using it, make sure to use BC and AD, or BCE and CE; don't mess them up. \n\nHere are some conventions to follow:\n \n* BC should appear after the numerical year: 900 BC\n* Ad should appear before the numerical year: AD 510\n* BCE should appear after the numerical year: 510 BCE\n* CE should appear after the numerical year: 510 CE\n\nYou can use periods after the letters: 1100 B.C., A.D. 1088. That is a style issue. If only you keep consistency in your writing, it will be fine."},"__N_SSG":true}
